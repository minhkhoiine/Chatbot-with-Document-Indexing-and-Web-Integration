Acrylic Nails:\n\n\tAcrylic nails are one of the most popular choices for artificial nails.\n\nThey are made by combining a liquid monomer with a powder polymer, creating a durable and long-lasting material that can be sculpted into various shapes and lengths.\n\n\tThe application process involves brushing the liquid and powder mixture onto the natural nails or nail tips and then shaping them to the desired length and style.\n\n\tAcrylic nails are known for their strength and durability, making them ideal for those who want to add length and durability to their natural nails.\n\n\n\n\tHowever, acrylic nails require regular maintenance, including refills every two to three weeks as the natural nails grow out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrystal Nails:\n\n\tCrystal nails are a variation of acrylic nails but with a clear or translucent appearance, giving them a glossy and glass-like finish.\n\n\tLike acrylic nails, crystal nails are created using a liquid monomer and a clear powder polymer. However, the final result is a shiny and transparent nail.\n\n\tThe application process for crystal nails is similar to that of acrylic nails, involving the sculpting of the material onto the natural nails or nail tips.\n\n\tCrystal nails are known for their elegant and sophisticated look, making them a popular choice for special occasions or those who prefer a natural appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nGel Nails:\n\n\tGel nails are created using a gel-based polish that is applied to the natural nails or nail tips and then cured under a UV or LED lamp.\n\n\tGel polish is thicker and more flexible than traditional nail polish, giving it a glossy and durable finish that can last for several weeks without chipping.\n\n\tGel nails are available in a wide range of colors and finishes, including glossy, matte, and shimmering.\n\n\tOne of the main advantages of gel nails is their quick drying time, as the curing process only takes a few minutes under the lamp.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowder Nails:\n\n\tPowder nails, also known as dip powder nails or SNS nails, involve dipping the natural nails or nail tips into a colored powder.\n\n\n\n\tThe powder is applied over a base coat and then sealed with a topcoat, creating a durable and long-lasting manicure.\n\n\tPowder nails are available in a wide range of colors and finishes, including matte, glossy, and glittery.\n\n\tOne of the main benefits of powder nails is their instant dry time, as the powder sets quickly without the need for a UV or LED lamp.\n\n\n\n\n\nPress On Nails:\n\n\tPress on nails are artificial nails that come pre-shaped and pre- painted, ready to be applied to the natural nails using adhesive tabs or nail glue.\n\n\tThese nails are convenient and easy to apply at home, making them a popular choice for those who want a quick and temporary manicure.\n\n\tPress on nails are available in various shapes, sizes, and designs, allowing for customization and creativity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSilk Wrap Nails:\n\n\tSilk wrap nails involve applying a thin layer of silk fabric or fiberglass over the natural nails to strengthen and protect them.\n\n\tThe silk wrap is applied using a clear adhesive and then trimmed and shaped to fit the nails perfectly.\n\n\tSilk wrap nails are ideal for those with weak or brittle nails, as they provide added strength and support.\n\n\tHowever, silk wrap nails are temporary and require regular maintenance, including refills every few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach type of nail has its unique advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to consider your preferences and lifestyle when choosing the right option for you.\n\n\n\nNail Polish vs. Gel Nails\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to nail enhancements, nail polish and gel nails are two popular options that offer distinct features and benefits. Understanding the difference between these two products is essential for achieving the desired nail look and maintaining healthy nails. In this guide, we'll explore the characteristics, application methods, and pros and cons of both nail polish and gel nails.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3199, "end_char_idx": 8120, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85040b47-a79e-455d-9fd1-5e98a2a933f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "85040b47-a79e-455d-9fd1-5e98a2a933f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.docx", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 18836, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2a2e2e6-8ac6-4245-aaed-bcf93159343c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.docx", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 18836, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "hash": "8178760b5f1b6311247223cd2b54c9f0c11d85767d9e991b3b86b24aa2620a50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5ff44f8-344d-4121-beef-d62cae127cde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.docx", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 18836, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "hash": "7eacae72cc4f4241209b6b026fd19ddb80d9f76b3ab76cd6a532548c27790944", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0a5f015-289a-4ae1-9d1b-a1e1d6d68827", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cb1cf380c1354aaea43347fffb29f4896a4e3e9c1eb3fbeb9919d5803d8fac5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Each type of nail has its unique advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to consider your preferences and lifestyle when choosing the right option for you.\n\n\n\nNail Polish vs. Gel Nails\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to nail enhancements, nail polish and gel nails are two popular options that offer distinct features and benefits. Understanding the difference between these two products is essential for achieving the desired nail look and maintaining healthy nails. In this guide, we'll explore the characteristics, application methods, and pros and cons of both nail polish and gel nails.\n\n\n\n\n\nNail Polish:\n\nNail polish, also known as nail enamel or nail lacquer, is a liquid- based product applied to the nails to add color and shine. It comes in a wide range of colors, finishes, and formulas, including matte, shimmer, metallic, and glitter.\n\nNail polish is typically air-dried and does not require any special curing equipment. It is easy to apply and remove, making it a convenient option for quick nail color changes.\n\nHowever, nail polish may chip or peel easily, especially with frequent hand washing or exposure to water.\n\n\n\n\n\nGel Nails:\n\nGel nails are a type of artificial nail extension that offers a durable and long-lasting finish. They are made from a gel-like substance that is cured under UV or LED light, providing a glossy and chip-resistant\n\ncoating.\n\nGel nails are available in a variety of colors and finishes, including opaque, sheer, and glitter. They offer a lightweight and flexible feel, similar to natural nails, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods.\n\nGel nails require special curing equipment and proper application techniques to ensure a flawless finish. While gel nails provide a durable\n\n\n\nand glossy finish, they may require professional removal and can be more challenging to remove at home compared to nail polish.\n\n\n\nUser Guide: Installing Acrylic Nails\n\n\n\nAcrylic nails are a popular choice for those who want to enhance the appearance and strength of their natural nails. Here's a step-by-step guide to installing acrylic nails at home:\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials Needed:\n\n\tAcrylic nail kit (includes acrylic powder, acrylic liquid, nail primer, nail tips, nail glue, acrylic brush)\n\n\tNail file\n\n\tNail buffer\n\n\tCuticle pusher\n\n\tCotton balls or pads\n\n\tNail polish (optional)\n\n\tNail polish remover (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Prepare Your Nails\n\n\tStart by removing any existing nail polish using nail polish remover and cotton balls.\n\n\tUse a nail file to shape your nails to your desired length and shape.\n\n\tGently push back your cuticles using a cuticle pusher to create a clean nail bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Apply Nail Tips\n\n\tSelect the appropriate size nail tip for each of your nails. Trim and file the tips if necessary to fit your natural nails.\n\n\tApply a small amount of nail glue to the underside of the nail tip.\n\n\n\n\tPress the nail tip firmly onto your natural nail, making sure it is centered and aligned with the edge of your nail bed.\n\n\tHold the nail tip in place for a few seconds to allow the glue to dry completely.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Trim and Shape the Nail Tips\n\n\tUse a nail clipper to trim the nail tips to your desired length.\n\n\tUse a nail file to shape the edges of the nail tips, creating your desired nail shape (e.g., square, oval, almond).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Apply Primer\n\n\tApply a small amount of nail primer to each of your natural nails. This helps the acrylic adhere better to your nails and prevents lifting.\n\n\tAllow the primer to dry completely before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Mix Acrylic Powder and Liquid\n\n\tPour a small amount of acrylic liquid into a dappen dish.\n\n\tDip your acrylic brush into the liquid and wipe off any excess liquid on the side of the dish.\n\n\tDip the brush into the acrylic powder, picking up a small bead of powder on the tip of the brush.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Apply Acrylic Mixture\n\n\tStarting near the cuticle, apply the acrylic mixture to your nail in a small, circular motion.\n\n\tUse the brush to spread the acrylic evenly over the entire nail surface, working quickly before the acrylic sets.\n\n\tContinue applying acrylic to each nail, one at a time, until all nails are covered.\n\n\n\n\tIf necessary, use a nail file to shape and smooth the acrylic surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Finish and Buff\n\n\tOnce the acrylic has dried, use a nail buffer to smooth out any rough edges and create a uniform surface.\n\n\tBuff the surface of the acrylic to remove any imperfections and create a shiny finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Optional: Apply Nail Polish\n\n\tIf desired, apply a coat of your favorite nail polish over the acrylic nails.\n\n\tAllow the polish to dry completely before applying a second coat, if needed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7536,

They are made from a gel-like substance that is cured under UV or LED light, providing a glossy and chip-resistant coating.

Gently push back your cuticles using a cuticle pusher to create a clean nail bed.   Step 2: Apply Nail Tips 1. Select the appropriate size nail tip for each of your nails. Trim and file the tips if necessary to fit your natural nails. 2. Apply a small amount of nail glue to the underside of the nail tip.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 975, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c3b7263-cbe7-4925-b663-a0558d852246": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c3b7263-cbe7-4925-b663-a0558d852246", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 84051, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6275c87b-f7c8-4689-8b15-f39eece3247d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 84051, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "hash": "24bad041e0d56a0c3e1a51d583f95c86172198d134e090c9d5155b73992fcaad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3. Press the nail tip firmly onto your natural nail, making sure it is centered and aligned with the edge of your nail bed. 4. Hold the nail tip in place for a few seconds to allow the glue to dry completely.   Step 3: Trim and Shape the Nail Tips 1. Use a nail clipper to trim the nail tips to your desired length. 2. Use a nail file to shape the edges of the nail tips, creating your desired nail shape (e.g., square, oval, almond).   Step 4: Apply Primer 1. Apply a small amount of nail primer to each of your natural nails. This helps the acrylic adhere better to your nails and prevents lifting. 2. Allow the primer to dry completely before proceeding.   Step 5: Mix Acrylic Powder and Liquid 1. Pour a small amount of acrylic liquid into a dappen dish. 2. Dip your acrylic brush into the liquid and wipe off any excess liquid on the side of the dish. 3. Dip the brush into the acrylic powder, picking up a small bead of powder on the tip of the brush.   Step 6: Apply Acrylic Mixture 1. Starting near the cuticle, apply the acrylic mixture to your nail in a small, circular motion. 2. Use the brush to spread the acrylic evenly over the entire nail surface, working quickly before the acrylic sets. 3. Continue applying acrylic to each nail, one at a time, until all nails are covered.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1291, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "402be28c-5c95-4961-923f-dd6403883918": {"__data__": {"id_": "402be28c-5c95-4961-923f-dd6403883918", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 84051, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "baad8d86-4ac9-4694-b1f8-bb7bb58dabaf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/khoivu/Desktop/chatbot/pdf/NailPro%2BSupply.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 84051, "creation_date": "2025-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-16"}, "hash": "585f5006efabc5fe798b7dbcea715bf46eea1bb025b5a4f2e72d95ceb7d259eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4.

Once the acrylic has dried, use a nail buffer to smooth out any rough edges and create a uniform surface. 2. Buff the surface of the acrylic to remove any imperfections and create a shiny finish.   Step 8: Optional: Apply Nail Polish 1. If desired, apply a coat of your favorite nail polish over the acrylic nails. 2. Allow the polish to dry completely before applying a second coat, if needed.   Step 9: Final Touches 1. Finish with a clear top coat to seal and protect your acrylic nails. 2. Apply cuticle oil to moisturize your cuticles and keep your nails healthy. 3.
